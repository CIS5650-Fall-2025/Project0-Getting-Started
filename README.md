### README

## SUMMAYR

    This is my first time coding with CUDA, so I'm not sure if I have successfully completed all the tasks for Project 0.

    Yesterday, I reviewed the class slide documents, which reinforced my understanding of how the GPU operates and its specialized terminology. I was particularly confused about the number of threads that can run simultaneously, especially regarding CPU cores versus GPU cores. However, it's clear to me now.

    I also found some pretty good learning materials.
