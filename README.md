### 

Installing all the tools I need for GPU programming using an unfamiliar interface was certainly tricky! This was my first time setting up my own Windows system and first time using Visual Studio so this setup took a lot longer than expected. Thankfully everything seems to be working as expected. Proof below :)

The Nsight debugging tool looks like it will be very useful in identifying bugs in specific threads.

The Nsight Systems tool will be essential for optimizing code and ensuring efficient scaling with its detailed metrics and visualisations.
