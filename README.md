* Tested on: Windows 10, 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz 2.30 GHz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU (Personal Computer)

### CUDA GL Check Results

This project successfully demonstrates CUDA and OpenGL functionality. The program runs correctly and displays both blue and green regions, indicating proper CUDA/OpenGL interoperability.

**GPU Information:**

- GPU Model: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU  
- Compute Capability: 8.6 (SM 8.6)
- CUDA Version: 13.0

The program successfully shows my name "Muqiao Lei" in the title bar, confirming the code modification was completed correctly.

### Nsight Debugging

Successfully used Nsight Visual Studio Edition to debug the CUDA kernel. Key achievements:

- Set breakpoints in `kernel.cu` at line 79
- Used conditional breakpoints with `index == 2000`
- Examined thread execution with Autos and Warp Info windows
- Observed variable values including `blockIdx`, `threadIdx`, and `index`

![Nsight Debugging Session](images/nsight-debug.png)

The debugging session showed proper thread execution with:

- blockIdx = {x = 25, y = 0, z = 0}
- threadIdx = {x = 0, y = 2, z = 0}  
- index = 2000

### Nsight Systems Performance Analysis

Performed system-wide performance analysis using Nsight Systems 2025.3.2:

- Analysis session duration: 23.202 seconds
- Events collected: 4,762,994
- Total threads: 1,157
- Successfully profiled CUDA kernel execution and OpenGL rendering

### Nsight Compute Analysis

Due to a known issue with Nsight Compute on this project (as confirmed by course staff), this section was skipped per instructor guidance. The profiler works correctly with cuda-introduction projects but encounters errors with the main cuda-gl-check executable.
